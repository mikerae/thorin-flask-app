    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled Thorin's interest in
    recapturing his long lost family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had been the King under the Mountain when Smaug
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in the Shire, Gandalf
    decided to add Bilbo to their company because he knew that stealth and cunning were preferable to force. Gandalf
    also believed that someone like Bilbo could keep the sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from rash action. The
    superstitious Dwarves also considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other
    business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into their party.

        <h3>Thorin Oakensheild</h3>
        <p>
            Thorin II was born in TA 2746 to Dwarf prince Thráin II in the city of the Lonely Mountain. Early in his
            youth,
            he and the other Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in
            exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. This was demonstrated when he participated in the Battle
            of
            Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He fought with one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of Moria. At some
            point
            in the fighting, his shield broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the ground as a shield, he gained
            the
            epithet "Oakenshield," which would remain with him even in death.

        <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
        <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was the elder brother of their mother Dís. They were also
            nephews of Frerin, grandsons of Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thrór. Fíli's most distinguishing
            feature was his long nose, the longest of any of the Dwarves in Thorin's company.

        <h3>Óin</h3>
        <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. Óin's uncle was
            Fundin, the father of Balin and Dwalin. He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when travelling. Óin fought
            in the Battle of Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and
            Company on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the Dwarves
            who bet that Bilbo would come along with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin and his brother Glóin
            were usually in charge of preparing the fire for the Company as they were the most skilled out of the
            others. He fought in and survived the Battle of Five Armies, and later settled in the Lonely Mountain
            with King Dáin II Ironfoot, along with many other Dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

        <h3>Glóin</h3>
        <p>
            Glóin was born in TA 2783, after the dragon Smaug desolated Erebor. He was the younger child of Gróin
            and younger brother of Óin.

        <h3>Balin</h3>
        <p>
            Balin was likely born in the Lonely Mountain before the coming of the dragon Smaug. He had a younger
            brother named Dwalin, and was amongst those driven from their homes when Smaug attacked the Lonely
            Mountain. Afterwards, he may have lived in Dunland as a refugee, before fighting in the War of the
            Dwarves and Orcs which culminated in the Battle of Azanulbizar. Many years later, in approximately TA
            2841, he accompanied Thráin II, the father of Thorin, when he attempted to go back to the Lonely
            Mountain himself, but Thráin was captured and lost.

            younger brother of Balin. After fighting in the Battle of Azanulbizar at the age of 27, Dwalin
            accompanied Thráin II and Thorin Oakenshield to settle peacefully in the northern Ered Luin.

        <h3>Ori</h3>
        <p>
            Ori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains for many years. In the year TA 2941, Ori
            became a member of Thorin's Company and travelled with Thorin, Gandalf, Bilbo Baggins, and the other
            Dwarves on the quest for the Lonely Mountain, culminating in the death of Smaug. Finally, he and the
            other Dwarves of Thorin's Company fought in the Battle of Five Armies, which he survived.

            Before the Quest of Erebor, Dori lived in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with Nori and
            Ori. In TA 2941, the three became part of Thorin and Company, befriending Bilbo Baggins and traveling
            with him in search of Smaug's treasure at the Lonely Mountain.

            Nori, as was his brother Dori, was a capable flutist, and both seem to have carried their flutes with
            them. Both shared Bilbo's liking for regular meals. Before the Quest for the Lonely Mountain, Nori lived
            in Thorin's Halls in the northern Blue Mountains with his two brothers.

            Whilst he was a descendant of the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm, Bifur was not related to the royal House of
            Durin. Most of his familial relations are unclear, and what is known of his parentage is very little. He
            and his family were driven out of their home in the Lonely Mountain by the dragon Smaug, and were forced
            to live in exile, where the Dwarf warrior worked as a toy maker. Following Thorin II Oakenshield to a
            new life at his halls in the Blue Mountains, he continued his life as a toy maker.

        <h3>Bombur</h3>
        <p>
            Bombur's parentage is unknown. He was the brother of Bofur and cousin of Bifur. Bombur was not of
            Durin's line, although he was descended from the Dwarves of Khazad-dûm. His birth date is unknown,
            though it fell somewhere between TA 2763 and TA 2859; the brothers Fíli and Kíli were the youngest of
            the thirteen "by some fifty years," and, after Thorin was captured, Balin was "the eldest left." Fíli
            was born in TA 2859, and Balin was born in TA 2763. Bombur was thus roughly 150 years old during the
            quest. Prior to the journey, Bombur likely resided in the Blue Mountains alongside Thorin, after the
            loss of Thráin II.

        <h3>Gandalf</h3>
        <p>
            Originally called Olórin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. He was created by Ilúvatar before
            the Music of the Ainur[1], and was at the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Eä.[2] In
            his "youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and Nienna. He was associated with
            light and fire, much like Varda[3], yet his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and
            patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore the guise of an Elf, and sent them
            fair visions in their hearts that made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of
            Nienna, talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those who listened to him
            out of despair.
